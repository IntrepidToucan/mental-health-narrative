# Mental Health Narrative (Title TBD)

This README describes the technical details behind this game.

## Player Input

Uses the new Unity **Input System** to handle player input (docs: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html).

There's a bug in version 1.7.0 of the Input System that breaks the action map GUI
(see https://forum.unity.com/threads/unable-to-use-input-system-panel.1450204/ for context).


The Unity Package Manager seems to only show version 1.7.0.
Go to https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/changelog/CHANGELOG.html#182---2024-04-29
and click the "Add version 1.8.2 by name" link to download the latest version.
